>Prompt: Please read the dataset.

The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:

1. **pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3).
2. **survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3. **name**: Name of the passenger.
4. **sex**: Gender of the passenger.
5. **age**: Age of the passenger.
6. **sibsp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
7. **parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
8. **ticket**: Ticket number.
9. **fare**: Passenger fare.
10. **cabin**: Cabin number.
11. **embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
12. **boat**: Lifeboat number.
13. **body**: Body identification number.
14. **home.dest**: Home/destination.

Let me know if you need any specific analysis or visualization based on this dataset.

>Prompt: How do you think is the quality of this dataset?

To assess the quality of the Titanic dataset, we can look into several aspects such as missing values, data consistency, and accuracy. Let's go through each of these points:

1. **Missing Values**: Check for any missing data in the dataset.
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensure that the data types are appropriate for each column and values are within expected ranges.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Verify that the data appears to be correct (e.g., ages are reasonable, ticket prices are plausible).

I'll start by examining the missing values and data types.

### Analysis of the Titanic Dataset Quality

1. **Missing Values**:
   - **age**: 263 missing values
   - **fare**: 1 missing value
   - **cabin**: 1014 missing values
   - **embarked**: 2 missing values
   - **boat**: 823 missing values
   - **body**: 1188 missing values
   - **home.dest**: 564 missing values

   Significant missing data is present in the `age`, `cabin`, `boat`, `body`, and `home.dest` columns. This may affect any analysis or modeling performed with these features.

2. **Data Types**:
   - Most columns have appropriate data types (e.g., `int64` for numerical data, `object` for categorical/text data).
   - The `age` and `fare` columns are appropriately of type `float64`.

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - The `sex` column contains categorical data (male, female) and appears to be consistent.
   - The `pclass` column has integer values representing passenger classes, which is consistent with expectations.
   - The `embarked` column should contain categorical values (C, Q, S). 

4. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Ages seem to have reasonable values (e.g., `age` has values such as 29, 0.9167, etc.).
   - Ticket prices (`fare`) also appear to be within a plausible range, except for the one missing value.

### Summary
- **Strengths**: The dataset is structured with appropriate data types and contains relevant features for analysis.
- **Weaknesses**: A significant amount of missing data in certain columns, which could hinder analysis or require imputation strategies.

To further improve the dataset quality, missing values should be addressed appropriately, and any inconsistencies in categorical data should be cleaned.

Would you like to proceed with specific data cleaning steps, analysis, or visualization based on this dataset?

>Prompt: How do you think is the quality of this dataset?

I have created a table that shows basic statistics about the quality of the Titanic dataset. It includes columns for the number of missing values, data types, and the percentage of missing values for each column. 

You can review the table to identify which columns might need cleaning or imputation before any further analysis. Let me know if you need specific actions on the dataset or any further analysis.

>Prompt: How many passengers are in the dataset?

The dataset contains a total of 1,309 passengers. If you need further analysis or specific insights about these passengers, please let me know!

----

>Prompt: What is the average age ?

The average age of the passengers in the dataset is approximately 29.88 years. If you need more detailed statistics or further analysis, feel free to ask!

----

>Prompt: How many people died, how many survived ?

Out of the 1,309 passengers in the dataset:

- **809** people died.
- **500** people survived.

If you need further analysis or details, please let me know!

----

>Prompt: What was the survival ratio?

The survival ratio of the passengers in the dataset is approximately 38.20%. This means that about 38.20% of the passengers survived the Titanic disaster. If you need more insights or further analysis, feel free to ask!

----

>Prompt: What was the age distribution of the passengers in buckets of 10 years? Please show as table.

The bar chart above shows the age distribution of the Titanic passengers in buckets of 10 years. It provides a visual representation of how many passengers fall into each age group.

If you need further analysis or specific insights based on this distribution, please let me know!

----

>Prompt: Please create a horizontal barchart for the survial ratio per passenger class.

Here is the horizontal bar chart showing the survival ratio per passenger class. It indicates the proportion of survivors in each class. If you need further analysis or another visualization, please let me know!

----

>Prompt: Can you change the sort order to show 1st class on top ?

The horizontal bar chart has been updated to show the 1st class on top, followed by 2nd and 3rd classes. If you have any more requests or need further modifications, feel free to let me know!

----

>Prompt: What chart could be helpful to visualize distribution of genders?

To visualize the distribution of genders among the passengers on the Titanic, a few charts can be useful:

1. **Bar Chart**: Shows the count of male and female passengers.
2. **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the proportion of male and female passengers.
3. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Can show the distribution of genders across different passenger classes or survival status.

Which type of chart would you like to create?

----

>Prompt: Could you create a boxplot showing age destribution by class? 

Here is the boxplot showing the age distribution by passenger class on the Titanic. The plot illustrates the range, median, and quartiles of ages within each class. If you have any other requests or need further analysis, feel free to ask!
