**1 Dataset**

1.1. Please read the dataset.

1.2 How do you think is the quality of this dataset?

1.3 Please create a table to show basic statistics about the dataset quality.


**2 Deskriptive Statistik**

2.1 How many passengers are in the dataset?

2.2 What is the average age ?

2.3 How many people died, how many survived ?

2.4 What was the survival ratio?

2.5 What was the age distribution of the passengers in buckets of 10 years? Please show as table.


**3 Visualisierung**

3.1 Please create a horizontal barchart for the survial ratio per passenger class.

3.2 Can you change the sort order to show 1st class on top ?

3.3 What chart could be helpful to visualize distribution of genders?

3.4 Please create some alternative visuals.

3.5 Could you create a boxplot showing age destribution by class? 

**4 Relationen**

4.1 Is there a relation between gender and survival rate ?

4.2 How strong is this relation?

4.3 Please explain for non-statisticans. What about corellation coefficent?

4.4 Is there a relation between age group (in steps of 10 years) and survival rate ?

4.5 Can you create a heatmap of age group and passenger class that shows survival rate? Please use read and blue as colors.

4.6 Can you recreate the heatmap. Keep the coloring with the survival rate but show the total numbers of people that survived and in paranthesis people that did not survive.

**5 Vorhersage **

5.1 Can you create a model to predict survival? I want to enter age, sex and class of a person. 

5.2 Please give me the python code so i can run this locally


**6 Storytelling **

6.1 What are the parts and the structure of a good data story?

6.1 Can you help me to create a good data story on this dataset? Please consider all of the points mentioned above. 
The story should deal with the chance of survival, meaning survived=1.Also it should show chances of survival depending on sex and class.
Please create a narative for 6 personas, by on age and class, based on average rate of survival and average age, based on the combination of sex and class. Think of some names for the personas that could be realistic (use real titanic passenger names as a reference), a little text that wraps up the findigs and brings some emotions to the story.
